# Flight Delay Prediction

## About the Project

Using the [data of airline information from Data Expo 2009](https://community.amstat.org/jointscsg-section/dataexpo/dataexpo2009), this project presents:

- Statistical visualizations (histograms, barcharts, piecharts, heatmaps, ...) and analyses (t-test, Mann Whitney) on the data.

- Machine Learning models (Naive Bayes, Linear/Logistic Regressors, Decision Trees, Random Forests, SVM, Neural Networks, ...) to predict airflight departure delays.

- Feature selection models (PCA, SelectKBest, RFE).

- Evaluations, comparisons, and fine-tunings of models.

*May-June, 2021.*
